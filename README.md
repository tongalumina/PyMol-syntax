# Vim Syntax Highlighting for PyMOL Script

This is a fix of the PyMOL script Vim syntax file by
[speleo3](https://github.com/speleo3/PyMol-syntax), which is a mirror of the
original syntax file written by [Michal
Gajda](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2814) in 2009.

Updated to add and fix a few things that do not work in Vim 8.1+, including:

- syntax clustering
- definition numbers
- PyMOL colors

May be useful for editing .pml scripts of [PyMol](https://pymol.org). The syntax definition is not complete for PyMOL 2.4.0+.

## Installation

Use vim plug-in manager, e.g. vim-plug.
